# java-interview-questions


Normally expect following questions to a 5+ year of java experience :-

String questions: check if a string is a palindrome, check if a string is a substring of other string, reverse a string, find the largest palindrome in a string ,check if one string is a rotation of other string,

LinkedList questions: Reverse a linked list recursively(in-place) and iteratively, delete a node from linked list, find the nth node, find the nth node from the end, test if a linked list has a cycle, write test cases
